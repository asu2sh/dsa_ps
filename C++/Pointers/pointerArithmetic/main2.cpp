    //! reinterpret_cast in C++ | Type Casting operators
    // It is used to convert one pointer of another pointer of any type,
    // no matter either the class is related to each other or not.
    // It does not check if the pointer type and data pointed by the pointer is same or not.
    //! Syntax : data_type *var_name = reinterpret_cast <data_type *>(pointer_variable);
    //Return Type :It doesnâ€™t have any return type. It simply converts the pointer type.
